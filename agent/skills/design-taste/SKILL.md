# Design Taste System (Master Skill)

## Purpose

This is the **aggregated master design skill** for the DeskFlow agent workspace. It references all design sub-skills and declares the current active taste configuration. When in doubt about design direction, the agent should consult this skill first.

## Referenced Sub-Skills

1. **frontend-design** (v3.0.0) — Core UI/UX principles, DeskFlow-specific conventions, ALL page layouts (Dashboard, IDE, Terminal, External, Database, Insights, Stats, Browser, Settings, IDE Help), ALL component patterns (GlassCard 3 variants, TabBar, SectionHeader, StatCard, ChartContainer, Modal, StatusBadge, CategoryBadge, EmptyState, LoadingState), ALL architecture blueprints (Cross-Session Sync, Skill DSL, InitializeProgressModal, AnalyticsDashboard 3 variants, Context Management System, Session Categorization, Agent Readiness Protocol)
2. **impeccable** — 7 domain references (typography, color, spatial, motion, interaction, responsive, UX writing), 23 commands, 27 anti-patterns
3. **ui-ux-pro-max** — Industry-specific design rules, style library, color palettes, typography pairings
4. **taste-skill** — Tunable knobs (variance, motion, density), aesthetic matrix, anti-repetition rules
5. **frontend-external-infra** (v1.0.0) — Connected external libraries (shadcn MCP, Magic UI, Lucide, 21st.dev) for real component inventory, source routing table, anti-slop checklist, DeskFlow re-skin rules

## Unified Design Vocabulary

### Spatial Terms
- **Chrome**: The window frame, title bar, controls — non-content UI
- **Canvas**: The main content area where user work happens
- **Palette**: Sidebar, toolbars, floating panels — contextual tools
- **Overlay**: Modals, toasts, dropdowns — temporary layers above canvas
- **Gutter**: Space between major regions (sidebar ↔ canvas)

### Motion Terms
- **Entrance**: Element appearing (fade in, slide up, scale from 0)
- **Exit**: Element disappearing (fade out, slide down, scale to 0)
- **Transition**: State change within an existing element (color, position)
- **Emphasis**: Drawing attention to an element (pulse, shake, glow)
- **Choreography**: Coordinated sequence of multiple elements

### Color Terms
- **Base**: The deepest background color (zinc-950)
- **Surface**: Elevated backgrounds (zinc-900, zinc-800)
- **Accent**: Primary brand color (pink-500)
- **Semantic**: Status colors (emerald=success, amber=warning, red=error)
- **Muted**: Disabled, secondary, placeholder text (zinc-500, zinc-600)

## Decision Tree

When the agent needs to make a design decision:

```
1. What is the product type?
   → Consult ui-ux-pro-max industry rules

2. What is the component purpose?
   → Consult frontend-design component patterns

3. Is this user-facing or internal?
   → User-facing: Apply full design system
   → Internal: Apply minimal chrome, maximum function

4. What are the current knob values?
   → Low variance: Stick to conventions
   → High variance: Introduce one bold element
   → Low motion: Instant or 150ms transitions
   → High motion: Spring physics, staggered sequences
   → Low density: Generous whitespace, single focus
   → High density: Tight packing, information-rich

5. Has this pattern been used recently?
   → Yes: Apply anti-repetition rule (vary color, shape, or animation)
   → No: Use the pattern freely

6. Does this violate any anti-patterns?
   → Yes: Stop and reconsider
   → No: Proceed
```

## Design Reference Index

When `include_references` is enabled, the following DESIGN.md templates are available:

| Reference | Style | Best For |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| Claude | Warm terracotta, editorial | AI agent interfaces, chat UIs |
| Linear | Ultra-minimal, purple accent | Project management, task lists |
| Vercel | Black/white precision, Geist | Dashboards, developer tools |
| Stripe | Purple gradients, weight-300 | Financial data, tables, charts |
| Supabase | Dark emerald, code-first | Developer tools, API docs |
| Sentry | Dark dashboard, data-dense | Error tracking, monitoring |
| PostHog | Playful dark, colorful charts | Analytics, funnels, graphs |
| Raycast | Sleek dark chrome, vibrant | Command palettes, quick actions |

To use a reference: "Apply [Reference] style to this component" — the agent will read the DESIGN.md and extract relevant patterns.

## Pre-Generation Checklist

Before generating any UI component:

- [ ] Read current knob values from context
- [ ] Identify product type and consult industry rules
- [ ] Check anti-repetition rules against recent history
- [ ] Verify no anti-patterns will be violated
- [ ] Select appropriate component pattern from frontend-design
- [ ] Determine if design reference should be applied
- [ ] Log design decisions for future anti-repetition checks

## Activation Criteria

**This skill is ALWAYS active when the Design Skills system is enabled.** It serves as the central dispatcher for all design decisions.

**The agent should:**
1. Read this skill FIRST when design questions arise
2. Follow the decision tree for systematic choices
3. Delegate to sub-skills for domain-specific knowledge
4. Report the active configuration at the start of design tasks
