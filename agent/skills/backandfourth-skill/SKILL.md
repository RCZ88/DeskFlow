# 🤝 AI Collaboration Bridge — From Idea to Implementation

## Core Philosophy

**This is not a prompt. This is a conversation starter.**

The `generate-prompt` skill solves problems by packaging them into a one-way brief. The `ai-collaboration-bridge` skill establishes a **two-way communication channel** between three parties:

### 3-Party Roles (Real-World Setup)

| Role | Who | Responsibility |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **CZ (Human)** | The user | Relay messages between the two AIs. Copy-paste output from one into the other. Does NOT edit AI messages. |
| **Project Owner (opencode)** | The coding agent running in this codebase | Knows the codebase. Gathers context. Writes artifacts to `agent/docs/`. Answers REQUEST questions with CONTEXT responses containing actual source code. |
| **Specialist (External AI)** | Claude / GPT-4 / Gemini / etc. | Does NOT have codebase access. Debugs the problem or designs the solution. Asks REQUEST questions. Produces RESULT.md. |

### How Communication Works

```
1. CZ tells opencode: "collaborate with [external AI] on [bug/idea]"
2. opencode writes INITIAL_PROMPT.md (with full source code EMBEDDED — external AI has no file access)
3. CZ copies INITIAL_PROMPT.md content → pastes into external AI chat
4. External AI responds with REQUEST questions
5. CZ copies REQUEST → pastes into opencode chat
6. opencode answers with CONTEXT (actual source code)
7. CZ copies CONTEXT → pastes into external AI chat
8. Repeat 4-7 until external AI produces RESULT.md
9. CZ copies RESULT.md → pastes into opencode chat
10. opencode implements the fix
```

**Key principle:** The initial package must contain ALL relevant source code inline — the external AI has zero codebase access. The Specialist drives the conversation by requesting specific files or clarifications. The Project Owner fetches them. This iterative refinement produces a far better result than a single monolithic prompt.

## How This Differs from `generate-prompt`

| | `generate-prompt` | `ai-collaboration-bridge` |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger** | AI coding agent hits a technical wall | User has a new idea or concept |
| **Direction** | One-way: problem → solution | Two-way: idea ↔ refinement ↔ solution |
| **Context** | Agent gathers everything upfront | Agent gathers source code inline; Specialist asks for rest |
| **Output** | Single RESULT.md | Conversation thread + final RESULT.md |
| **User role** | Passive (agent handles everything) | Active relay — copy-pastes between two AIs |
| **Best for** | Bug fixes, refactors, layout fixes | New features, architecture decisions, complex designs |
| **External AI access** | N/A (single AI) | Zero — all source code must be embedded in messages |

## MANDATORY: Two-Case Validation Framework

Before using this skill, determine which case applies:

### Case 1: Raw Idea → Collaboration
**You have an idea in your head. Nothing is written yet.**

Workflow:
1. User describes the idea verbally/raw
2. AI coding agent uses this skill to analyze the idea
3. Agent creates Context Bundle from scratch (scanning codebase)
4. Agent crafts Initial Prompt
5. Agent sends to Specialist AI
6. Back-and-forth begins

### Case 2: Existing Context → Collaboration Continuation
**You already have partial context, a previous RESULT.md, or an ongoing conversation.**

Workflow:
1. User references existing work ("continue from where we left off with the sidebar")
2. AI coding agent loads existing context
3. Agent performs **Context Gap Analysis** — what does the Specialist ALREADY know vs. what changed?
4. Agent creates a "delta context bundle" with only new/changed code
5. Agent crafts a "continuation prompt" that references previous work
6. Back-and-forth resumes from where it left off

**The skill MUST handle both cases. It must detect which case applies and adapt its behavior.**

---

## Phase 1: Idea Analysis & Context Gap Detection

### Step 1 — Parse the Raw Idea

Extract from the user's input:
- **Core concept**: What is the user trying to build? (1 sentence)
- **Motivation**: Why do they want this? What problem does it solve?
- **User-facing behavior**: What should the user see/do?
- **Technical hints**: Any technologies, patterns, or constraints mentioned?
- **Scope boundaries**: What is IN scope vs. OUT of scope?

### Step 2 — Map Idea to Codebase

Scan the codebase for:
1. **Existing similar features** — "We already have X, this is like X but with Y"
2. **Touch points** — Which files/modules will need modification?
3. **Dependencies** — What IPC channels, DB tables, services are involved?
4. **Design system impact** — New components? New tokens? New patterns?

### Step 3 — Context Gap Analysis

Create a table:

```
| Context Needed | Status | Location | How to Obtain |
|----------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| DB schema for sessions | ✅ Have | src/db/schema.sql | Already in bundle |
| IPC channel for new feature | ❌ Missing | Need to check preload.ts | Agent must fetch |
| Design tokens for new UI | ⚠️ Partial | tailwind.config.js | Include relevant section |
| User flow for similar feature | ✅ Have | src/pages/ExistingPage.tsx | Already in bundle |
```

**Rule:** If a gap exists, the Initial Prompt must explicitly say: *"We do not yet have [X]. If you need it, ask and we will fetch it."*

---

## Phase 2: Context Bundle Assembly

### Same Strict Requirements as `generate-prompt`

The Context Bundle MUST include actual source code, not descriptions. For every file the idea touches:

1. **Full TypeScript interfaces** — exact fields, types, defaults
2. **Full function implementations** — actual code with line numbers
3. **End-to-end IPC wiring** — one complete working channel example
4. **DB access patterns** — actual prepared statements, transactions
5. **Result/error wrapper types** — exact pattern used
6. **Current UI component source** — full JSX, props, states
7. **Design tokens** — actual hex codes, font stacks, spacing
8. **AI/provider call chain** — actual streaming/non-streaming code
9. **Database schema** — actual CREATE TABLE statements
10. **State management** — actual useState/useReducer declarations

### Case 2 Special Handling: Delta Bundles

If continuing from existing context:
- Include the **previous RESULT.md** or conversation summary
- Include only **changed files** since last exchange
- Include a "State Diff" section: "Since last conversation, these files changed: ..."
- Reference previous decisions: "In Round 2, we decided X. Here is the implementation."

---

## Phase 3: Initial Prompt Crafting

The Initial Prompt is the **first message** the Project Owner sends to the Specialist. It must be structured so the Specialist immediately understands:

1. **What the idea is**
2. **What context they have**
3. **What context is missing**
4. **How to ask for more context**
5. **What the expected output format is**

### Initial Prompt Structure

```markdown
# Collaboration Request: [Idea Title]

## Your Role
You are the Specialist AI. I am the Project Owner AI. I know the codebase; you know how to design and architect solutions. We will collaborate through a structured back-and-forth to refine this idea into an implementable specification.

## The Idea
[User's verbatim idea, cleaned up but preserving intent]

## Current Context (What I Have)
[Summary of attached Context Bundle]
- Project: [name, stack, architecture]
- Relevant files: [list with one-line descriptions]
- Existing patterns: [what conventions are already in use]

## Context Gaps (What I Don't Have Yet)
[List of missing context with labels]
- "If you need to see the IPC handler for X, ask and I will fetch it"
- "If you need the full DB schema, ask and I will include it"
- "If you need to see how Y component renders, ask and I will paste it"

## Conversation Protocol
**How we communicate:**

1. **You ask specific questions.** Format: `REQUEST: [specific file, schema, or clarification]`
2. **I fetch and respond.** Format: `CONTEXT: [file path]
[actual source code]`
3. **You refine your understanding.** Ask follow-ups or propose a design.
4. **When ready, you produce RESULT.md.** Format follows our standard specification.

**Rules:**
- Do NOT assume context you don't have. Ask for it.
- Do NOT design for features whose backend doesn't exist. Flag them.
- Do NOT produce a monolithic answer. Iterate with me.
- When you need to see code, ask for the EXACT file path.

## Scope
- IN: [what's included]
- OUT: [what's excluded]

## Expected Output
After our conversation converges, produce:
1. **RESULT.md** — The complete design specification
2. **Implementation Plan** — File-by-file changes
3. **Backend Audit** — Any missing IPC/services/DB schemas flagged

## First Question
[The Project Owner asks an opening question to start the conversation, OR leaves it open for the Specialist to begin]
```

---

## Phase 4: Conversation Protocol Design

This is the "rules of engagement" document. All three parties follow it.

### Communication Flow

```
External AI ←→ CZ (Human) ←→ opencode (Coding Agent)
```

CZ relays messages **verbatim** between the two AIs. Do not summarize or edit.

### Specialist AI (External — has NO codebase access) Rules

1. **Start with questions, not answers.** Before proposing a design, identify 3-5 specific context gaps.
2. **Use REQUEST format:**
   ```
   REQUEST: src/services/SessionService.ts — I need to see how sessions are created to design the new flow.
   ```
3. **Ask one thing at a time.** Don't request 10 files at once. Iterate.
4. **Flag backend gaps immediately.** If you need an IPC channel that doesn't exist, say so.
5. **When converged, produce RESULT.md** following the exact format from `generate-prompt` skill.

### Project Owner AI (opencode — has full codebase access) Rules

1. **Embed ALL source code in INITIAL_PROMPT.md.** The external AI has zero file access — every relevant file must be pasted inline.
2. **Fetch exactly what was requested.** Don't send extra files "just in case."
3. **Use CONTEXT format:**
   ```
   CONTEXT: src/services/SessionService.ts (lines 45-89)
   [actual source code pasted here]
   ```
4. **If a file doesn't exist, say so.** Don't make up code.
5. **If the request is ambiguous, ask CZ to clarify with the Specialist.**
6. **Track the conversation state.** Write each round to `conversation/round-XX.md`.

### CZ (Human — relay) Rules

1. **Copy-paste verbatim.** Do not summarize, edit, or rephrase AI messages.
2. **Paste INITIAL_PROMPT.md** into the external AI chat to start.
3. **Paste each REQUEST** from external AI → into opencode chat.
4. **Paste each CONTEXT** from opencode → into external AI chat.
5. **When external AI produces RESULT.md**, paste it into opencode chat for implementation.

### Conversation State Tracker

opencode maintains this in `conversation/round-XX.md`:

```
Round 1:
- Specialist asked for: [X]
- We provided: [Y]
- Decisions made: [Z]

Round 2:
- Specialist asked for: [A]
- We provided: [B]
- Decisions made: [C]

Convergence status: [ongoing / ready for RESULT.md]
```

---

## Phase 5: Execution & Back-and-Forth Management

### When to Stop the Conversation

Stop when ANY of these are true:
1. The Specialist says: "I have enough context to produce RESULT.md"
2. The Specialist has asked for context 3 times and received it each time
3. The conversation has gone 5 rounds without new questions
4. The user explicitly says "that's enough, produce the result"

### How to Produce the Final Package

When converged, the Specialist produces:
1. **RESULT.md** — Complete design spec (same format as `generate-prompt`)
2. **Context Bundle Used** — List of all files referenced during conversation
3. **Backend Gaps** — Any missing backend that needs separate implementation

The Project Owner then:
1. Saves RESULT.md verbatim (per `generate-prompt` Rule 1)
2. Runs the three-phase post-result workflow (per `generate-prompt` Phase 1-3)
3. Implements or delegates implementation

---

## Terminal Workspace Integration Notes

This skill is designed to work WITHIN the DeskFlow terminal workspace. The 3-party relay model:

### How Context Flows

1. **opencode reads the codebase** — gathers relevant files, reads `src/`, `agent/`, etc.
2. **opencode writes INITIAL_PROMPT.md** — ALL source code embedded inline (external AI has no file access)
3. **CZ copy-pastes** INITIAL_PROMPT.md → external AI chat
4. **External AI responds** with REQUEST questions
5. **CZ copy-pastes** REQUEST → opencode chat
6. **opencode answers** with CONTEXT (actual source code from codebase)
7. **CZ copy-pastes** CONTEXT → external AI chat
8. **Repeat** until external AI produces RESULT.md
9. **CZ paste** RESULT.md → opencode chat
10. **opencode implements** the fix

### Skill Invocation

When the user says "collaborate with [AI] on [X]":

```
User: "collaborate with Claude on the sidebar bug"
→ Agent detects: this is a collaboration request
→ Agent invokes: ai-collaboration-bridge skill
→ Agent asks: "Which external AI? (Claude, GPT-4, Gemini, etc.)"
→ User selects target
→ Agent reads codebase, gathers context
→ Agent writes INITIAL_PROMPT.md with all source code embedded
→ Agent presents: "INITIAL_PROMPT.md is ready. Copy its content into your [external AI] chat."
→ CZ relays back-and-forth between the two AIs
→ External AI produces RESULT.md
→ CZ pastes RESULT.md into opencode
→ opencode implements
```

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT To Do)

1. **Don't send file paths without code.** The external AI has zero codebase access — embed ALL source code inline.
2. **Don't let the Specialist hallucinate APIs.** If it asks for a file, provide it. If the file doesn't exist, say so.
3. **Don't skip the Context Gap Analysis.** You must know what you DON'T have.
4. **Don't produce RESULT.md in Round 1.** The first output from the Specialist should be QUESTIONS, not answers.
5. **Don't lose conversation state.** Track what was decided in each round.
6. **Don't let CZ edit AI messages.** Relay must be verbatim — any rephrasing loses technical precision.
7. **Don't assume the Specialist remembers context.** Each message must be self-contained.
